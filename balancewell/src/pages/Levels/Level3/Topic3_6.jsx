<Paragraph>
            Many people send money to family overseas or help pay for things like:
</Paragraph>
<ul>
<li>School fees back home</li>
<li>Medical bills for relatives</li>
<li>Groceries for elderly parents</li>
<li>Religious or cultural obligations</li>
</ul>
<Paragraph>
            This is called remittances — and it’s common.
            But if not planned for, remittances can leave very little left for yourself — especially if rent and food costs are rising.
            Planning doesn’t mean giving less — it means giving smart so you don’t run out.
