        <Paragraph>
          In Australia, a common way to check if your rent is affordable is to compare it to your income.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          This is called your <Text strong>rent-to-income ratio</Text>. It tells you what percentage of your income is going toward rent.

        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          üí° If you spend more than <Text strong>30%</Text> of your income on rent, it may be considered ‚Äúrent stress.‚Äù<br />
          This means you might struggle to afford food, medicine, bills, or savings after paying rent.
        </Paragraph>

        <Divider orientation="left">Example Calculation</Divider>
        <Paragraph>

          Then: $180 √∑ $500 = <Text strong>36%</Text> of your income goes to rent<br />
          That‚Äôs above 30%, and may cause pressure in other areas of life.
